# Warframe-Code-Claimer

IN THE WORKS WILL ADD TO THIS LATER

Trying to work on a GUI for it, but if you want to use it now
you just have to uncomment the last bit of Webscraper.py and input your relevant information at the top

You must have Brave Browser for it to work. It might work on Chrome or any other Chromium-based browser
but I haven't tested it yet.

This project is just for me to get some practice with Python.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD: webscraper.py, chromedriver.exe, browser_option.py
