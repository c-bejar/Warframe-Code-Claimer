# Warframe Code Claimer

### Purpose

This is just a personal project of mine to see what I could 
do with my very limited kknowledge of Python. Warframe Codes 
pretty much only give you one thing, and that's Glyphs. If 
you want to collect all the Glyphs but don't feel like typing 
every code in manually, this is meant to speed up the process 
if only just a little. It's very unoptimized right now because 
I don't really use Python very much. This was meant for my own 
practice.

### How does it work

Very simply, you put in your email and password (don't worry, 
nothing's being saved anywhere), find the directory to your 
browser's exe, find the directory for your browser's 
default user profile, and it logs into your account on your 
own browser and starts claiming codes scavanged from the 
internet. The directory to your browser is to open up your 
browser and the default user profile is meant to keep you 
signed in when it's looping through every code to claim. 
Without it, every time it goes to a new code, you'd be signed 
out before you could even claim a code.
